# 198. House Robber
*Easy*
09/11/18

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:
```
Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
```

## Solutions
* dp
  - 两个variable: rob, notrob,分别是rob现在的house和不rob现在的house的最大收入
  - for loop中，如果robcurrent，则等于notrob上一个加上这个house的金钱
  - 如果notrob，则等于notrob上一个和rob上一个中的最大值
```
public int rob(int[] num) {
    int rob = 0; //max monney can get if rob current house
    int notrob = 0; //max money can get if not rob current house
    for(int i=0; i<num.length; i++) {
        int currob = notrob + num[i]; //if rob current value, previous house must not be robbed
        notrob = Math.max(notrob, rob); //if not rob ith house, take the max value of robbed (i-1)th house and not rob (i-1)th house
        rob = currob;
    }
    return Math.max(rob, notrob);
}
```
