# 1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition
*Medium*

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target.

Return the number of non-empty subsequences of nums such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal than target.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo ```10^9 + 7```.



Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [3,5,6,7], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 subsequences that satisfy the condition.
[3] -> Min value + max value <= target (3 + 3 <= 9)
[3,5] -> (3 + 5 <= 9)
[3,5,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
[3,6] -> (3 + 6 <= 9)
```
Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,6,8], target = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 subsequences that satisfy the condition. (nums can have repeated numbers).
[3] , [3] , [3,3], [3,6] , [3,6] , [3,3,6]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,4,6,7], target = 12
Output: 61
Explanation: There are 63 non-empty subsequences, two of them don't satisfy the condition ([6,7], [7]).
Number of valid subsequences (63 - 2 = 61).
```
Example 4:
```
Input: nums = [5,2,4,1,7,6,8], target = 16
Output: 127
Explanation: All non-empty subset satisfy the condition (2^7 - 1) = 127
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
1 <= target <= 10^6
```

## Solution
- Sort and use two pointers.
Use Example 4.
1. Sort the array from min to max.
  - `[5,2,4,1,7,6,8]` -> `[1,2,4,5,6,7,8]` (size = 7)
2. Two pointers: `lo = 0` and `hi = n - 1` where `n` is the array size.
  - `lo = 0` and `hi = 6`
3. While `lo <= hi`, we pick `nums[lo]` as the min number of the subsequence, and look for the largest possible `hi` such that `nums[lo] + nums[hi] <= target`.
  - The largest `hi` to satisfy the condition is `hi = 6`.
4. Since we decide to pick `nums[lo]` for sure, for the numbers at indices `lo + 1` to `hi`, we can choose to pick them or not. Therefore, we have `2^(hi - lo)` choices. We add this number to the total `count`.
  - Add `2^6` to total `count`.
5. Increment `lo` and repeat steps 3 and 4 while `lo <= hi`.
  - Now `lo = 1`...
- Time complexity
  - Sort: O(nlgn)
  - Two pointers: O(n)
  - Total: O(nlgn)
- Space complexity: O(1)
- NOTE
  - To avoid overflow:
    1. Use type `long` for `count` to store total number of subsequences
    2. When computing power, do not use `Math.pow()` as it may lead to overflow. Implement a helper method `int pow(int base, int exp, int mod)`. Mod when needed to avoid overflow.
