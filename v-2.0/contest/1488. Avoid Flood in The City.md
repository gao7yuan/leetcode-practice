# 1488. Avoid Flood in The City
**Medium** *6/29/2020*

Your country has an infinite number of lakes. Initially, all the lakes are empty, but when it rains over the nth lake, the nth lake becomes full of water. If it rains over a lake which is full of water, there will be a flood. Your goal is to avoid the flood in any lake.

Given an integer array rains where:

`rains[i] > 0` means there will be rains over the `rains[i]` lake.
`rains[i] == 0` means there are no rains this day and you can choose one lake this day and dry it.
Return an array ans where:

`ans.length == rains.length`
`ans[i] == -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.
`ans[i]` is the lake you choose to dry in the ith day if `rains[i] == 0`.
If there are multiple valid answers return any of them. If it is impossible to avoid flood return an empty array.

Notice that if you chose to dry a full lake, it becomes empty, but if you chose to dry an empty lake, nothing changes. (see example 4)



Example 1:
```
Input: rains = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day full lakes are [1,2,3]
After the fourth day full lakes are [1,2,3,4]
There's no day to dry any lake and there is no flood in any lake.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: rains = [1,2,0,0,2,1]
Output: [-1,-1,2,1,-1,-1]
Explanation: After the first day full lakes are [1]
After the second day full lakes are [1,2]
After the third day, we dry lake 2. Full lakes are [1]
After the fourth day, we dry lake 1. There is no full lakes.
After the fifth day, full lakes are [2].
After the sixth day, full lakes are [1,2].
It is easy that this scenario is flood-free. [-1,-1,1,2,-1,-1] is another acceptable scenario.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: rains = [1,2,0,1,2]
Output: []
Explanation: After the second day, full lakes are  [1,2]. We have to dry one lake in the third day.
After that, it will rain over lakes [1,2]. It's easy to prove that no matter which lake you choose to dry in the 3rd day, the other one will flood.
```
Example 4:
```
Input: rains = [69,0,0,0,69]
Output: [-1,69,1,1,-1]
Explanation: Any solution on one of the forms [-1,69,x,y,-1], [-1,x,69,y,-1] or [-1,x,y,69,-1] is acceptable where 1 <= x,y <= 10^9
```
Example 5:
```
Input: rains = [10,20,20]
Output: []
Explanation: It will rain over lake 20 two consecutive days. There is no chance to dry any lake.
```

Constraints:
```
1 <= rains.length <= 10^5
0 <= rains[i] <= 10^9
```

## Solution1
- Simulation
1. Use a set `fullLakes` to represent lakes that are full.
2. Use a linked list `toEmpty` to represent the lakes to be emptied.
3. Iterate `rains`, when visiting a lake `i`, if `fullLakes` does not contain `i`, add it to the set; if `fullLakes` contains `i`, remove it from `fullLakes` and add it to `toEmpty` list.
4. Reset `fullLakes` to an empty set and re-iterate `rains`. When `rains[i] == 0`, check the elements in `toEmpty` from list head one by one until we find a lake in `fullLakes` set. This is the lake we want to empty on this day.
- Time
  - First iteration: O(n)
  - Second iteration: O(n^2)
  - Total: O(n^2)
- Space: O(n)

## Solution2
1. Use a `Map` to store `lake - full day` pairs. This indicates on which day this lake becomes full for the last time.
2. Use a `Set` to store (previous) dry days.
3. Iterate `rains`. If it is a dry day, we add this dry day to the set (and set the default lake to dry to `1` - or any number in range). If it is a rainy day, we need to check if this lake is already full by checking `map.containsKey()`. If it is not full already, we simply put the new key-value pairs into the map. If the lakes is previously full, we need to find the day when it previously became full, and find a dry day after that day. If we can find one, we dry the lake on that dry day and put the new value in. Otherwise, flood...
4. To find the earliest dry day from the set after a certain date, if we use a hash set, we need to visit all the members in the set, which takes O(n), and O(n^2) in total. If we use a **TreeSet**, we can reduce the time complexity to O(lgn), and O(nlgn) in total.

- Time: O(nlgn)
- Space: O(n)

### Code
```Java
public int[] avoidFlood(int[] rains) {
    int n = rains.length;
    int[] res = new int[n];
    Map<Integer, Integer> lakeDays = new HashMap<>(); // lake - last day it becomes full
    TreeSet<Integer> drydays = new TreeSet<>(); // available dry days
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (rains[i] == 0) {
            // dry day
            drydays.add(i);
            res[i] = 1; // default, may change
        } else {
            // rainy day
            int lake = rains[i]; // which lake becomes full
            if (lakeDays.containsKey(lake)) {
                // if lake already full
                // find a dry day
                int lastDay = lakeDays.get(lake); // last day it became full
                Integer day = drydays.higher(lastDay); // the earliest day after last day it became full - we want to dry it
                if (day == null) {
                    return new int[0]; // no such day, flood
                }
                res[day] = lake;
                drydays.remove(day);
            }
            // update lake-day map
            lakeDays.put(lake, i);
            res[i] = -1;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

### Java
- `treeset.higher(e)` - find the least element that is strictly greater than e, or null if cannot find one.
